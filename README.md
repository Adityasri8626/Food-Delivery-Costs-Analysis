# 🍴 Food Delivery Costs Analysis  

Thrilled to share my project **“Food Delivery Costs Analysis”**, where I explored how delivery platforms manage costs, commissions, and pricing strategies using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**.  

This project provided valuable insights into **customer behavior, cost structures, and revenue models** for food delivery platforms.

## 🏢 About the Project  

Food delivery platforms like **Zomato, Swiggy, and UberEats** thrive on balancing customer satisfaction with profitability.  
This project focuses on **understanding delivery costs, order patterns, and commission structures**, helping businesses optimize **pricing, offers, and delivery logistics**.

## 🔍 Workflow  

![Workflow](images/food_delivery_workflow.png)


1️⃣ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Removed duplicates & handled missing values  
   - Converted time stamps into daily/weekly buckets  

2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Distribution of delivery costs  
   - Commissions vs. Order Value  
   - Peak-hour demand analysis  

3️⃣ **Visualization**  
   - Cost breakdown by order size  
   - Discounts impact on margins  
   - Payment method preference charts  

4️⃣ **Insights & Business Takeaways**  
   - Peak hours (Lunch/Dinner) = high delivery fee  
   - Wallet/UPI cheaper for platforms than Cards  
   - Large orders reduce per-item delivery cost  
   - Seasonal offers boost orders but cut profit margins  

---

## 📊 Key Insights  

- **Peak Hours:** Costs spike between 1–3 PM & 7–10 PM 🍕  
- **Discount Impact:** Higher order volume, but reduced profitability 🎁  
- **Payment Preference:** UPI & Wallets most cost-efficient 💳  
- **Order Size:** Bigger baskets = lower cost per item 📦  
- **Commission Patterns:** High-value orders attract more commission %  

---

## 🌟 Business Impact  

✅ **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust delivery fees by peak vs. off-peak hours  
✅ **Personalized Offers:** Target users with balanced discounts  
✅ **Cost Optimization:** Promote low-fee payment methods  
✅ **Logistics Efficiency:** Streamline delivery networks
