# Food-Delivery-Costs-Analysis

I’m excited to share that I’ve completed the Masterclass on "Food Delivery Costs Analysis Using Python" 

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
The first step involved cleaning and preparing the data. We focused on ensuring the dataset was in the correct format for analysis. This included tasks such as:
- Converting the "Order Date and Time" and "Delivery Date and Time" columns to datetime format using Pandas.
- Checking for and handling any missing or inconsistent data.
- Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and the types of data it contained, such as order values, delivery fees, payment methods, and more.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Once the data was clean, we moved on to exploratory data analysis. This step involved:
- Analyzing various aspects of the data to identify patterns and trends.
- Visualizing the data using graphs and charts to get a better understanding of distribution and relationships.
- Calculating summary statistics to gain insights into key metrics like average delivery cost, most common payment methods, and the impact of discounts and offers.

### In-Depth Analysis
With a clear understanding of the data, we performed a deeper analysis to uncover specific insights related to food delivery costs. This included:
- Calculating the total commission fees and payment processing fees.
- Analyzing the distribution of order values and delivery fees across different regions and time periods.
- Identifying factors that contribute to higher or lower delivery costs, such as distance, time of day, and order size.

### Key Insights and Findings
Through this analysis, we were able to derive several important findings:
- The majority of orders were placed during peak meal times, leading to higher delivery fees.
- Orders with discounts and offers tended to have a higher order value, but this was balanced by increased commission fees.
- The payment method used significantly impacted the overall cost, with certain methods incurring higher processing fees.

### Conclusion and Next Steps
This Masterclass has equipped me with valuable skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and in-depth cost analysis using Python. I’m eager to apply these skills to real-world projects and continue exploring the field of data analysis.
